# Prometheus Installation Script for Linux

Prometheus Installation Script will install Prometheus on the linux server automatically whichever version you want. This script will also create the service (systemd) script as well. This script will help you running prometheus on the custom IP Address/Domain/URL, custom PORT, SSL, and HTTPS

What's in this script:
1. Fully Automatic scipt with user interactive.
2. User Required version will be installed.
3. Custom System script will be created automatically.
4. Prometheus will run as HHTPS, SSL, Custom URL/Domain/URL.
5. Only 2 step user interactive script just only for version.

Note: This script is not public, it is private script. Intentionally I didn't released this script as public, talk to me or send me the message if you need the script.
